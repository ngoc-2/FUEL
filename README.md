## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Xcode 15+
- iOS 17+
- Apple Developer account (for HealthKit and App Groups)
- Anthropic API key

### Setup

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngoc-2/FUEL.git
cd FUEL
```

2. Copy the config templates:
```bash
cp Fuel/Info.plist.template Fuel/Info.plist
cp Fuel/Fuel.entitlements.template Fuel/Fuel.entitlements
```

3. Open `Fuel.xcodeproj` in Xcode

4. Update `AppConfiguration.swift` with your details:
   - Set your privacy policy, support, and terms URLs
   - Add your Anthropic API key in Settings at runtime

5. Register your App Group (`group.com.yourname.fuel`) in the Apple Developer Portal and update it in `AppConfiguration.swift`

6. Build and run on a real device (HealthKit does not work in the simulator)
